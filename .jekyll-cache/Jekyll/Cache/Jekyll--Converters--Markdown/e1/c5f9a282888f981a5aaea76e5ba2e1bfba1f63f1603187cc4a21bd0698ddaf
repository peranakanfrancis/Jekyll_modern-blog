<h2 id="engage-with-the-viewer">Engage with the viewer</h2>
<p>An explainer video (also known as a homepage video, overview video or conversion video) is designed to explain your company, product, service or subject in a way that your audience can understand in two minutes or less. Most explainer videos cover four key points: the problem, the solution, the features and benefits, and how the solution works.</p>

<h2 id="more-than-just-explainer-videos">More than just explainer videos</h2>
<p>The key to a solid explainer video is keeping it short and engaging, while still conveying the right information. No matter what you’re explaining, an explainer video should leave your viewers with a clear understanding of what you do and a desire to take the next step.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-concept-for-an-explainer-video">Create a concept for an explainer video</h2>
<p>Using animation to explain your best features, you can imaginatively show the real differences between you and your nearest competitors - while we work unflaggingly to develop the brilliant script &amp; images you need to keep on winning.</p>

<h3 id="explainer-animation-video">Explainer animation video</h3>
<p>You can demonstrate how your process or products work by telling a story. Or use animated characters to relate to your customers. Explainer Videos can take on a ‘tell not sell’ approach to educate your audience - or go route one with a full-on sales message.</p>

<h3 id="infographic-video">Infographic video</h3>
<p>If your message has a lot of data or needs to explain a complex solution - then explain it clearly with an infographic video. By showcasing your stats &amp; business processes you’ll generate a credible proof of claim that will give buyers peace of mind. An Infographic Video is a uniquely visual style - built from a foundation of animated captions and charts in a persuasive clear way.</p>
