Having a great website user experience requires understanding the problems different visitors have to solve. And there is a difference between responsive design and a completely separate mobile website. Both can be beneficial at times. If you want the same content on your mobile website as on your desktop of your website, responsive design is the way to go.</p><h2 id="rank-higher-in-mobile-search-results">Rank higher in mobile search results</h2><p>But, if you’re looking for a mobile version that is extremely limited or a stripped down version of your full website, a separate mobile version may be a better option. The advantage to responsive design is that it allows the website to use the same code and same files for all displays, while a true mobile version is a separate code base.</p><h2 id="best-user-experience-for-increased-online-revenue">Best user experience for increased online revenue</h2><p>As mobile and tablet traffic continues to grow at a rapid pace, the need to have a site optimized for these devices is a necessity.

Whether you have an eCommerce website and are selling products online, or you’re a service based business looking to increase leads, we’ve worked with clients who have faced the same scenarios that you’re facing now. With ever-growing competition in the online space, it’s important to stay on top of your game and have a company dedicated to your ongoing success.</p><h2 id="seo--conversion-rate-optimization-effects">SEO &amp; conversion rate optimization effects</h2><p>Understanding the connection between SEO and conversion rate is critical in any conversion optimization campaign. When searching on the web users are more likely to click and convert on results at the top. Typically, web users that go to the bottom of page 1 or to page 2, are merely “window shopping” and are not serious buyers. This connection drives down conversion rates and leads to worthless traffic. At MyBetterWeb our goal is to combine conversion rate optimization with SEO efforts to create a campaign that ranks, converts and sells your business better.</p><h3 id="how-is-conversion-rate-optimization-works">How is conversion rate optimization works?</h3><p><strong>1. Website audit</strong></p><p>The conversion rate optimization process is similar to a search engine optimization experience. We start by having MyBetterWeb team members review your website and put together “red flag” items. These are issues that we understand to be major issues from the beginning.</p><p><strong>2. Filter data</strong></p><p>After we realize these and review them with the client, we fix the issues and move into an analytical phase.</p><p><strong>3. Analysis site</strong></p><p>Analytics allow us to determine traffic and visitor patterns on your website. Typical questions we ask are, “Where are visitors leaving?”, “Why are they not checking out?” and “How can we be sure they call you?”.</p><p><strong>4. Fine tuning</strong></p><p>By looking at statistics we can figure out where weak spots are in your website and begin to implement improvements.</p><p><strong>5. Optimize further</strong></p><p>It’s an ongoing process of making changes, analyzing the results and continuing to increase the conversion rate month after month.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div> <script type="text/javascript"> (function () { var options = { whatsapp: "+601165137507", // WhatsApp number call_to_action: "WhastApp me", // Call to action position: "right", // Position may be 'right' or 'left' pre_filled_message: "Hi, I'm interested in making website with you.", // WhatsApp pre-filled message }; var proto = document.location.protocol, host = "getbutton.io", url = proto + "//static." + host; var s = document.createElement('script'); s.type = 'text/javascript'; s.async = true; s.src = url + '/widget-send-button/js/init.js'; s.onload = function () { WhWidgetSendButton.init(host, proto, options); }; var x = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; x.parentNode.insertBefore(s, x); })(); </script>   <script src="js/vendors/trianglify.min.js"></script> <script src="js/vendors/TweenMax.min.js"></script> <script src="js/vendors/ScrollToPlugin.min.js"></script> <script src="js/vendors/cash.min.js"></script> <script src="js/card-modern-blog.js"></script> <script src="js/modern-blog.js"></script></body></html>
